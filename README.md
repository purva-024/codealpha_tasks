Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Use measurements of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) as input data.
● Train a machine learning model to classify the species based on these measurements.
● Use libraries like Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building.
● Evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance using test data.
● Understand basic classification concepts in machine learning.

Features : 
•	The data was successfully split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, resulting in 120 training samples and 30 testing samples.
•	A Logistic Regression model was trained on the training data.
•	The trained Logistic Regression model achieved perfect scores (1.0000) for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.
•	The confusion matrix showed that the model correctly classified all 30 instances in the test set across the three Iris species (10 setosa, 9 versicolor, and 11 virginica).
•	The classification report confirmed the perfect precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.00 for each individual class (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

Setup Instruction : 

Load and prepare data
•	Load the Iris dataset and prepare it for model training, including splitting the data into training and testing sets.
